Hello World! This is my first blog post, Yay!

It goes without saying that everybody blogs these day, be it micro blogging or macro blogging for fun or profit. I have jumped in the bandwagon and joined the crowd. I will be blogging here for a variety of reasons. 

1. To write and share my thoughts in a coherent fashion; I keep a short dairy where i write the most important things as they happen to me, but my sheer negligence and lack of accountability had lead me to stare down my iPad for a few minutes, then nod off to a sea of sleep without doing any actual writing.

2. To keep things in perspective; I&#8217;m tired of reading, learning, watching, listening and researching to a lot of stuff. This isn&#8217;t bad per se, but it takes away one&#8217;s creativity. I believe it&#8217;s best i re-produce what i have learnt or read into something that actually aid me in my intellectual and spiritual growth.

3. Online Presence; Like most people, I pretty much use the internet for reading(news and refrence) and communication(E-mail, social media and calling back home). I&#8217;m not heavy social media user but frequently use Twitter to discover news and interact with like-minded people, this has disappeared last few months because getting into twitter has become a herculean task since it&#8217;s blocked here in China. I don&#8217;t mind spending few minutes or dollars waiting and investing in a quality [VPN][1] but the noise and junk is increasing, not good news for a guy who spent whole lot to get there. I hope blogs to be my main source of news and interaction.

P.S Good to keep my data on my own and control what I share, to whom I share with and for what reason. 

4. To fiddle with WordPress and Coding; I&#8217;m a keen user of WordPress and develop almost all my website, whether for friend or business, in WordPress. There&#8217;s no better way to learn than on your own site. ( Between I&#8217;m not that good a web developer but can hold my own in HTML5, CSS, JQuary, WordPress and surprisingly, some server aspects). 

5. Interact and connect with like-minded people who are ready to help and get helped. Surprisingly, the entire blogging community.( Facebook and Google, take note!)

This are just the few major reasons i can think of right now, I will tweak and tune as i grow into my role as a blogger and welcome everyone to enjoy and read my blog. 

All feedback are welcome. Thank you.
