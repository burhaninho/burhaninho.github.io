The key to [learning][1] to stop **procrastination** is to shift your focus toward concentrating on results. Many people work frantically each day and accomplish very little.  
It is counterproductive to concentrate on so many tasks that you cannot accomplish, they may cost you time and energy with no results. Many people seem to spend a lot of time and energy only to achieve very few results.  


You can learn how to stop procrastination and achieve success in all you do if you learn the appropriate time management and organizational skills.  
>Procrastination is the art of keeping up with yesterday. 

Here are few keys to beating procrastination:

## Prioritize 

Working efficiently requires much less energy than tackling several tasks at once and never completing any of them.  
You can more effectively manage your time if you make a list each day of every task you need to complete in order of importance.  
Finish each task before starting on the next.  
Organizational and time management skills will reduce your level of stress and increase your productivity.  
Problems and demands can seem overwhelming at times and leave you feeling overburdened and out of control. The proper time management tools, including a to do list, will help you keep your priorities in order and give you a plan to follow each day. Concentrate on the important elements of your tasks and stop working frantically with no accomplishments.

## Break down large chunks into smaller components 

If your tasks seem large, break them into individual components until they seem more manageable. With a precise plan you can eliminate most of the problems you face during the day and gain a sense of pride and accomplishment when you see a noticeable difference in your productivity level. 

## Organize your life 

Procrastination tends to leave you with a feeling of frustration and a sense of never finishing anything no matter how hard you work.  
To find success both at work and at home, you must organize your daily tasks and your life. Time management skills are among the most important you&#8217;ll ever learn. Learning to prioritize and do the right things at the right time will help you reach your goals on a daily basis.  
<q> Procrastination is the grave in which opportunity is buried </q>  
Exercise & eat right! Yes, that’s right. If you take the time to exercise, you will actually have more energy and will procrastinate less. Also, avoid those simple sugars that “give you a boost”. It may give you an immediate rush, but you will “dump” just shortly there after. Eat complex carbohydrates which provide a slower, steadier release of energy throughout the day.

## Be effective 

Being effective means doing the right things in a timely manner. Your effectiveness depends on learning how to stop procrastination.  
You can delegate tasks to others to free up your time to do the urgent tasks to meet your objectives in order to be more productive. Being inefficient and frustrated equates to poor performance.  
<q> Procrastination is suicide on the installment plan </q>

## Use your time wisely 

You can lower your stress level and achieve your goals by using your time wisely and learning to stop procrastination. Determine your priorities, set achievable goals, and plan wisely to enable you to make the best use of your time.

## Experiment 

Develop a system that works for you. There is no cookie-cutter approach to overcoming procrastination. A system that may be very successful for one person, could fail miserably for another. Try different “programs” on and be patient. You will find a system that fits you perfectly. 

## Just do it! 

Just do it! I realize this phrase is completely over-used, but let’s face it, it applies. Sometimes we just need to buckle down and complete that unbelievably miserable task that we have been dreading for so long. I guarantee you that you will have more energy when you are done.

## And finally 

Learn your strengths and your weaknesses.  
Learning to stop procrastination will allow you to lessen the time spent on performing tasks that you dislike and gives more time to do things you like.
