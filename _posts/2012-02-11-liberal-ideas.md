title: Liberal Ideas

> Whenever I hear people talking about ** Liberal Ideas, ** I am always astounded that men should love to fool themselves with empty sounds. An Idea should never be liberal; it must be vigorous, positive, and without loose ends so that it may fulfill its divine mission and be productive. The proper place for liberality is the realm of emotions.
