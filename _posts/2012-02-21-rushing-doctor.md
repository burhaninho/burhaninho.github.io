![Rushing Doctor][1]  
A doctor entered the hospital in a hurry after being called in for an urgent surgery. He answered the call as soon as he could, changed his clothes & went directly to the surgery block.

He found the boy’s father pacing in the hall waiting for the doctor. On seeing him, the dad yelled, “Why did you take all this time to come? Don’t you know that my son’s life is in danger? Don’t you have any sense of responsibility?”

The doctor smiled & said, “I am sorry, I wasn’t in the hospital & I came as fast as I could after receiving the call. And now, I wish you’d calm down so that I can do my job.” The father replied, “Calm down?! What if your son was in this room right now; would you calm down? If your own son dies now what would you do?” said the father angrily.

The doctor smiled again & replied: 

الَّذِينَ إِذَا أَصَابَتْهُم مُّصِيبَةٌ قَالُوا إِنَّا لِلَّهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ

“Who, when disaster strikes them, say, “Indeed we belong to Allah , and indeed to Him we will return.” (Quran 2:156)

Doctors cannot prolong lives. Go and do dua for your son, we will do our best by Allah’s Grace.” “Giving advices when you’re not concerned is always easy.” murmured the father.

The surgery took some hours after which the doctor went out happy. “Thank Allah your son is saved” Without waiting for the father’s reply the doctor rushed off down the corridor. As he hurried away he called back, “If you have any questions, please ask the nurse.”

“Why is he so arrogant? He couldn’t wait for a few minutes so that I ask about my son’s state” replied the father.

The nurse answered, tears coming down her face, “His son died yesterday in a road accident, he was at the burial ceremony when we called him for your son’s surgery. Please forgive him, he rushed off to finish burying his son.”

Moral: Never judge anyone’s state, because you never know how their life is & what they’re going through. Always believe in the best in people.
