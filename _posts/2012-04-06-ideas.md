title: Do Not Covet Your Ideas
---

>Do not covet your ideas, give away everything you know and more will come back to you.
You will remember from school other students preventing you from seeing their answers by placing their arm around their exercise book or exam paper.
It is the same at work, people are secretive with ideas, &#8220;Don&#8217;t tell them that, they will take credit for it.&#8221;
The problem with hoarding is you end up living off your reserves. Eventually you&#8217;ll become stale.
If you give away everything you have, you&#8217;re left with nothing. This forces you to look, to be aware, to replenish.
Somehow the more you give away the more comes back to you.
Ideas are open Knowledge. Don&#8217;t Claim Ownership.
They&#8217;re not your ideas anyway, they&#8217;re someone else&#8217;s. They&#8217;re out there floating by on ether.
You just have to put up in a frame of mind to pick them up.&#8221;
