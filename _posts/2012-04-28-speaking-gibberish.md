**Caption:** 
We see the whole world from the perspective we&#8217;ve spent our whole lives cultivating. But if we do anything, it must be to realize this perspective is only one of millions, Billions perhaps. If we rely on ours alone, it&#8217;s like reading one letter and assuming we have read the whole sentence. In the end, we are all just speaking gibberish.
