[Uncatchable: A Story of America&#8217;s Most Elusive Fugitive][1]

>George Wright, America&#8217;s most elusive fugitive, ran for forty years. He ran from the cops after escaping from prison. He ran from the feds after the most brazen hijacking in history. He ran from the authorities on three continents, hiding out and blending in wherever he went. It was a historic runâ€”and now that it&#8217;s over, he might just pull off the greatest escape of all.

Truly, Humans can change. An inspirational read.
