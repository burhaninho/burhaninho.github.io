title: Secrets of Making Friends
---
A Reddit user gives serious advice on friendship, it stuck with me because i have learnt all this lessons the hard way.

> Do you want a lot of close friends who genuinely care about you? Here&#8217;s my secret:  
> Be kind. Ask questions. Don&#8217;t wait to talk but actually listen. If someone offers you a glass of water say yes; it feels good to do things for people. If you are in social situation where people don&#8217;t really know each other break the ice with something fun. Be well informed but only to reply, not to just spout out facts. Call a friend out of the blue and see how they are doing. If you are speaking with someone and you have started three straight sentences with &#8220;I&#8221; that is one too many.  
> But most importantly do not be negative. The world has enough sarcastic and/or negative people. Be stoic when needed and warm when needed but remember that everyone needs a little light sometimes and you can be the person that brings that to them.
