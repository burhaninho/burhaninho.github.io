I&#8217;m feeling sad and disappointed that [Github][1] is blocked in China. I learn a lot of coding by forking different repositories than I do reading tutorials on the internet. The code on most tutorials feel rushed. This is yet another reason to leave China.

Update: Github is back online now. I don&#8217;t know what happedned, but i guess there was a plugin hosted there that hampered with a train ticketing site, the site couldn&#8217;t handle all the requests coming from the plugin and people who wanted to buy tickets for the upcoming Chinese New Year holidays, from February 9th.  
There was also a lot of uproar on [Sina Weibo][2]. [Kai Fu Lee][3],a Taiwanese-born American information technology executive, writer, and computer scientist, has tweeted [this][4] yesterday, and a lot of people are thanking him for the unblocking. Internet Democracy.
