title: On Competence
---
A while ago, I was watching a British TV series called [Junior Doctors: Your Life in Their Hands][1]. I was pretty surprised how many times the young doctors were not sure what to do or perhaps didn&#8217;t know what to do. I say this because our deepest concern in medical school most of the time is if we can be competant enough not to tell our patients &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221; or worse &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure about this&#8221;.  
It&#8217;s also the reason why most of medical students spend so much of thier time with books, one more book makes us not to miss out one more thing.

I know a lot of medical students confuse competence with competition, we are very competitive just becuase a lot of us have to work hard to get into medical school, stay in medical school and graduate at top of our classes. I do hope we remain competant enough in our medical practise. For one, I&#8217;m looking forward to the day I can say I&#8217;m a good doctor.
