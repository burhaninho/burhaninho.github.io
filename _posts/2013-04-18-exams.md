Now I lay me down to study,  
I pray the Lord I won&#8217;t go nutty,  
And if I fail to learn this junk,  
I pray the Lord that I won&#8217;t flunk.

But if I do, don&#8217;t pity me at all,  
Just lay my bones in the study hall,  
Tell my teacher I did my best,  
Then pile my books upon my chest.

Now I lay me down to rest,  
I pray I&#8217;ll pass tomorrow&#8217;s test,  
If I should die before I wake,  
That&#8217;s one less test I&#8217;ll have to take.
