title: Need and Greed
---
> Honda or a BMW, the Road remains the same for all. You travel with economy class or business, your destination doesn&#8217;t change. A CK or a Rolex, the time is the same. There is nothing wrong in dreaming or leading a luxurious life&#8230;. What needs to be taken care of is &#8220;let the NEED not become GREED&#8221; because needs are always meet but greed is never fulfilled.
