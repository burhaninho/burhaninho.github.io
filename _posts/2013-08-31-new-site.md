This is my new site. I have moved it into a new [domain][1] which is my moniker, meaning young Burhan. I have wanted to do this for very long time but was busy doing internship and studying mostly for exams. I bought this domain two weeks ago when [Hostgator][2] was running a promotion for new domain names. I no longer had any excuses of not getting my own domain name and finally took the plunge. I hope I can also blog more, at least one post a week and improve my writing in the process. I would also like to improve the design aspect of the site, but not sure when I will be able to realize it. Just watch this space.
