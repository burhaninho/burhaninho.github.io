title: Woes Of Manchester United

Phil Jones playing in midfield. That says it all.  

The last few games have been disappointing. This season, Manchester United is breaking a lot of records:

-West Bromwich&#8217;s first win at Old Trafford in 35 years.  
-Everton&#8217;s first win at Old Trafford in 21 years.  
-Newcastle United&#8217;s first win at Old Trafford in 41 years.  
-Manchester United&#8217;s first consecutive losses at Old Trafford since 2001.  
-Manchester United has lost as many games as the entirety of last season.

Just the wrong records.
