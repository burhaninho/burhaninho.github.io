The paper reports that every Friday over a period of months a couple of years ago, hospital staff found the patient occupying a certain bed in intensive care lying dead with no apparent cause.  At first it seemed coincidental.  Then doctors feared a 'killer disease'.

Deaths continued.

Finally, a nurse noticed the Friday cleaning lady doing her weekly chores.  This maid would enter the ward, unplug the life-support system beside the bed, plug in her floor polisher, clean the ward, and once again plug in the patient, leaving no trace of the cause of the patient's death.

How many died in the South African Floor Polisher Massacre?  Possibly several.  The Free State health and welfare department won't comment but is investigating.
