An old lady dialled 999 after falling over in her house at Iffley, Oxfordshire.  She didn't wake the other members of the family.

As the ambulance men were carrying her out of the front door on a stretcher, her son roused from his slumbers by the noise staggered onto the landing, panicked at the sight of strange men in his home, and tripped all the way downstairs, knocking himself out.

His wife came rushing out of the bedroom to see what was wrong.

Observing her husband lying on the hall floor, she promptly fainted and fell downstairs herself.

The paramedics now had THREE casualties to take to A&E instead of one.

The tally rapidly became four when the family dog rampaged furiously into the hall, and inflicted an indignant bite on the bottom of one of the ambulance men.

A spokesman for the Oxford Ambulance Service said: It was quite a night, actually!
