description: The European super league reaction by Mohamed Burhan through tweets

A series of tweets I wrote on my twitter timeline about my thoughts about the European Super League

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is it just me or the reaction to the Super League by the English media is a bit hypocritical, especially the protest by fans and the moralization by the pundits, The same pundits who make head-spinning money from clueless fans</p>&mdash; Mohamed Burhan (@burhaninho) <a href="https://twitter.com/burhaninho/status/1385766042018803714?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 24, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The protesting fans want their clubs to sign average player for expensive money (Maguire) and demand to fire their great manager (Wenger) because he sells their top players in order to raise money for their clubs</p>&mdash; Mohamed Burhan (@burhaninho) <a href="https://twitter.com/burhaninho/status/1385766659927937028?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 24, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The craziest is Boris Johnson who wants to privatize every industry in England but is against the best clubs in the country going their way, he wants a fan-led socialist system for the clubs. Well Boris, let&#39;s start the old boys Eton clubs</p>&mdash; Mohamed Burhan (@burhaninho) <a href="https://twitter.com/burhaninho/status/1385767917992640512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 24, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If the Premier League continues with the same format and introduces a fan-led football clubs, the premier league will turn into Bundesliga and you will get 19 Stokes and a Bayern Munich running away with league in March</p>&mdash; Mohamed Burhan (@burhaninho) <a href="https://twitter.com/burhaninho/status/1385768917759455232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 24, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">But someone may say the Premier league is competitive and will only get better if the greedy owners leave, not really. Clubs face dwindling revenues, lack of English talent (higher transfer fees and contracts due to demand-supply mismatch) and Brexit.</p>&mdash; Mohamed Burhan (@burhaninho) <a href="https://twitter.com/burhaninho/status/1385770504326242304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 24, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Although the super league structure of founding clubs plus others is a bit elitist and was dead on arrival, their solution shouldn&#39;t be discounted and would have been Premier League 2.0, the Big 6 with Real, Barca, Juve, PSG and Milan every week</p>&mdash; Mohamed Burhan (@burhaninho) <a href="https://twitter.com/burhaninho/status/1385771637245583362?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 24, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It would have been something to look forward to every week instead of the drub and predictable games we see these days, but this isn&#39;t what benefits the English media and pundits especially <a href="https://twitter.com/GNev2?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GNev2</a> <br>and only if only the fans were not so short-sighted</p>&mdash; Mohamed Burhan (@burhaninho) <a href="https://twitter.com/burhaninho/status/1385772902927138817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 24, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">These are my thoughts for now and we will see how it goes, I had hoped to write a blog post but felt too lazy to research about the topic. Adios.</p>&mdash; Mohamed Burhan (@burhaninho) <a href="https://twitter.com/burhaninho/status/1385773998106050565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 24, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
