title: Exceptional Results
description: Getting exceptional results means doing less, right away and right now.

Three steps to exceptional results:

#### Do less

Stop dividing your attention. Prioritize your tasks from the most important and urgent to the least important.

#### Do it right now. 

Once you have identified the essential, go fast. Maintain a bias toward action.

#### Do it the right way. 

Acting quickly doesn't mean acting carelessly. Get to work right away, but keep working on it until it's right.
