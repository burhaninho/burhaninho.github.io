title: Time Billionaire
description: The time billionaire mental model concept in making a decision about what to pursue in life. A billion seconds in 31 years.
---

I came over this concept a while ago while listening to a Tim Feriss show, the time billionaire concept is intriguing and insightful and will be one of the mental models I will use whenever I make a decision. 

> *Tim Ferriss:* So time billionaires. What does that refer to?

> *Graham Duncan:* I was listening to a guy introduced a speaker a while ago. And he was saying people don’t really understand the difference between billionaires and millionaires. He said a million seconds is like 11 days. **A billion seconds is 31 years**. And I remember that …

> *Tim Ferriss:* Oh, shit. That’s a hell of a way to think about it.

> *Graham Duncan:* Right?
>
> *Tim Ferriss:* Wait. Can you say that one more time?

> *Graham Duncan:* A million seconds is 11 days. A billion seconds is slightly over 31 years. And I was thinking about – Tyler Cowen has a thing about cultural billionaires –

> *Tim Ferriss:* Marginal Revolution?

> *Graham Duncan:* Yeah. In one of his books, he talks about cultural billionaires. I feel like in our culture, we’re so obsessed, as a culture, with money. And we deify dollar billionaires in a way that – it’d be nice to co-opt that term the way Tyler Cowen did with cultural billionaires. And I was thinking of time billionaires that when I see, sometimes, 20-year-olds – the thought I had was they probably have two billion seconds left. But they aren’t relating to themselves as time billionaires. And I was thinking about how if you could – what would Rupert Murdoch, who’s worth $20 billion – he’s 87 years old. What would he pay if he could take the next five years of someone’s 20-year-old healthy body, mind, etc.? And for that 20-year-old, how would they price it? Because I was thinking at various points of my career, I might have sold the next five years for something.

> And over time, my pricing has gone vertical because the next five years, if I were to lose – and the key to this question is that you can’t sell the five at the end of your life. You gotta sell them right now. I don’t know how I’d price it because my kids are of a certain age that they’ll never be again. But I don’t know that I live every day that way. But I aspire to. So I was trying to capture – I heard Tim Urban on your podcast. And I started reading his stuff. And I find his writing style and the topics he is interested in just amazing. He has this concept of life calendar. And I bought his life calendar. He sells it as a poster. And what he does is he puts a week – he does a circle for each week. So he has 52 circles on the horizontal and then 90 rows so that you can see a 90-year life in weeks. And what’s startling about the picture – again, to this question of how long is a billion seconds – is how short it actually is.
