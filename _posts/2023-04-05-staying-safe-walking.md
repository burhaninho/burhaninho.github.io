The recent news about the founder of Cash App, Bob Lee, being attacked with a knife near San Francisco city center and ultimately dying from his injuries, is both heartbreaking and alarming. Unfortunately, this type of violence is becoming more common in many cities in the USA, due to problems such as homelessness, drug addiction, and lack of support from the government. As someone who lives and works in Downtown Minneapolis, where crime and homelessness have increased since George Floyd's death and the protests that followed, this news hits close to home.
However, rather than living in fear, there are simple tips and habits that we can adopt to stay safe and vigilant when walking in dangerous places. Here are some easy-to-follow tips that can help you stay safe:
First and foremost, always be aware of your surroundings, especially when crossing the street. Look both ways and make sure no cars are coming.
If you take the same route every day, it's easy for someone to predict where you'll be. Mix it up and take different routes to stay unpredictable.
When walking on the road, walk against the traffic so you can see the cars coming towards you. This will help you avoid getting hit and someone coming behind you.
Don't draw attention to yourself when you're walking in public. Act like you're busy or distracted to make yourself a less attractive target.
Don't stare at people or try to eavesdrop on their conversations. This can make you look suspicious and draw unwanted attention to yourself.
If someone is acting aggressively toward you, try to walk away and de-escalate the situation. Don't engage in a fight if you can help it.
Stay away from areas that have a reputation for being dangerous. This will help you avoid unnecessary risk.
If you feel like someone is looking at you, it's important to stay aware of your surroundings. Try to make eye contact with the person and show that you're aware of their presence. This could discourage them from approaching you or trying to harm you.
If you witness something illegal happening, like a drug deal or a fight, it's best to get away as quickly as possible. Instead, make a note of any important details you can remember and walk to safety.
If someone has a weapon and is trying to harm you, it's important to stay calm and think quickly. Back away slowly and try to create some distance between yourself and the attacker. If you need to run, do so as fast as you can.
If you have to fight, remember to use your legs to keep some distance between yourself and the attacker. If all else fails, do whatever you can to protect yourself.
These tips are practical, effective, and can make a difference in keeping you safe. Remember, staying aware of your surroundings and being prepared for different situations can help keep you safe. Let's all take a proactive approach to our safety and well-being!
