title: Be Decisive
description: Decisiveness demands action, not endless deliberation. 
---

Just decide. Pick a path and take it. Do not get stuck, paralyzed by fear that you might choose wrong. Perfect is an enemy of action. 
There is no such thing as a perfect choice, only the choice you make. It's hard to see the end from the start. But that's fine. Each step will reveal the next. 
Trust yourself. You have good judgment. And if you stray, you can correct yourself. If you wait for the elusive best choice, you'll get nowhere. Stagnate. Spin your wheels. 
The only wrong choice is no choice. So decide. Choose. Begin. You have what it takes to start. You'll figure out the rest along the way.
