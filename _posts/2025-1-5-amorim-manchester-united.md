Composure, fluidity, and decisive execution—this was Manchester United’s performance today against Liverpool. For once, there was a refreshing sense of control in midfield, led by the assured presence of Manuel Ugarte and Bruno Fernandes. The duo orchestrated United’s attacking transitions, combining skillful dribbling with intelligent ball distribution. Their ability to use possession effectively was reminiscent of the days when Michael Carrick and Paul Scholes dominated the midfield.

## Midfield Control
Ugarte, in particular, has grown into a pivotal figure for this team. His defensive awareness and offensive contributions were on full display, exemplified by a perfectly weighted pass to Fernandes, who swiftly released the ball to Joshua Zirzkee. Zirzkee, in turn, delightfully set up Harry Maguire for a clinical finish—a move that epitomized United’s newfound coherence in attack.

## Marauding Wingback
The wings were another area of dominance. Diogo Dalot made the most of Trent Alexander-Arnold’s defensive vulnerabilities, exploiting the right channel with purposeful dribbling and precise crosses. The first goal showcased this perfectly: Fernandes driving into space and threading a pass to Lisandro Martínez, whose clinical finish brought back memories of Ryan Giggs’ legendary FA Cup winner against Arsenal in 1999.

## Cohesive Defense
Defensively, United were resolute. Lisandro Martínez delivered a masterclass in anticipation and positioning, mopping up loose balls with ease. Harry Maguire, often a subject of scrutiny, looked commanding and composed, showing a level of confidence that has been sorely missed. Meanwhile, Liverpool struggled to impose themselves, their attack lacking a focal point in the absence of a target man. Luis Díaz was ineffective, and United’s backline ensured any threat was swiftly neutralized.

However, while Manchester United’s performance was a marked improvement, it wasn’t without caveats. Liverpool’s own disjointed display played into United’s hands. Alexander-Arnold’s inability to track back and their lack of cohesion in the final third were glaring weaknesses. Yet, credit must be given where it’s due: United capitalized ruthlessly on these deficiencies.

This match was a glimpse of what this team is capable of when every player contributes to a unified game plan. The challenge now is to sustain this level of composure and efficiency. A single dominant performance against a faltering Liverpool side is not enough. Consistency and identity must become Manchester United’s hallmark if they are to compete at the highest level.

Today was a step in the right direction, but the journey is far from over.
