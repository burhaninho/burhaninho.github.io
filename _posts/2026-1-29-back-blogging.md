description: starting to write on this blog again
---

I’ve been meaning to write on this blog for a long time, but honestly, time passed and I forgot this blog existed. Life happens and priorities shift.

This year, though, I’m trying to do things differently. I’ve decided to be more disciplined and make an effort to write here again, even if it’s not perfect or consistent.

I’m juggling a lot, including residency I started last year, which takes a big share of my time and energy. The past two years especially have been busy, and most of the time I simply didn’t have enough time to sit down and write, even when I wanted to.

On top of that, I have family responsibilities. I’m have four children now which takes an awful lot of your time,however, whenever I get a chance, I plan to come back here and put my thoughts into words.

No promises, just intention — and that’s a start.
